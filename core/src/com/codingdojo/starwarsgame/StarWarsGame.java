//THIS IS OUR MAIN SPOT FOR GAME CODE
public class StarWarsGame extends ApplicationAdapter {

//HIGH SCORES: Need to decide on time or Tie Fighters shot down for points. High scores page is Arcade style so we don't need login info. 
	//Will need DB for name entered and score. One to one?
	
//GRAPHICS: RO Michael can you do something cool?
	
//START PAGE: Start button, Title, top 3 scores
	
//Death Star Destroyed animation? Are we trying for that?

//Take this project one step at a time:
	//1. X Wing instead of bucket(tutorial), tie fighters instead of drops.
	//2. X Wing shoots. Consider where the xwing is, and different direction than tie fighter direction.
	//3. Sides of trench(closer boundaries) turrets generated on sides. How do they shoot?
	//4. After x amount of time, does exhaust port appear?
	//5. If time, how do we escalate difficulty? More tie's generated over time?
